## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User submits a transaction (income/expense)
2. The transaction is added to the list with a unique `id`
3. Totals are calculated using array methods:
   - `reduce()` to calculate balance
   - `filter()` for income & expense breakdown
4. All data is saved to **Local Storage**
5. Transactions persist even after refresh

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- DOM Manipulation  
- Array methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`  
- Template literals  
- `localStorage` for persistence  
- Form handling & event listeners
